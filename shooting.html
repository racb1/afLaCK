                    <h3>The Arcade Era (1970s-1980s)</h3>
                    <p>Shooting games trace their origins to the arcade cabinets of the 1970s, beginning with Taito's pioneering title Space Invaders (1978), which established fundamental mechanics still present in modern games. This was quickly followed by Galaxian (1979) and its successor Galaga (1981), which introduced more complex enemy patterns and special attacks. The fixed-screen format evolved with games like Missile Command (1980), which incorporated strategic elements by having players defend cities from incoming missiles. These early titles laid the groundwork for the genre with simple yet addictive gameplay focused on improving reflexes and accuracy.</p>

                    <h3>The Rise of First-Person Shooters (1990s)</h3>
                    <p>The early 1990s marked a revolutionary shift with Wolfenstein 3D (1992) and Doom (1993), which introduced immersive first-person perspectives that placed players directly in the action. These games established core FPS mechanics like strafing, varied weapons, and maze-like level design. The genre expanded rapidly with titles like Quake (1996), which pioneered online multiplayer deathmatch modes, and GoldenEye 007 (1997), which demonstrated how narrative-driven campaigns could work in the FPS format. By the end of the decade, Half-Life (1998) had redefined expectations by seamlessly integrating storytelling with gameplay, elevating the genre beyond pure action into a sophisticated narrative medium.</p>
