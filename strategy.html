                <div class="strategy-benefit-box">
                    <h3>Critical Thinking</h3>
                    <p>Strategy games excel at developing critical thinking skills by requiring players to evaluate complex situations, identify patterns, and assess multiple variables simultaneously. This analytical approach transfers to real-world problem-solving and decision-making processes in educational, professional, and personal contexts.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="strategy-benefit-box">
                    <h3>Planning & Foresight</h3>
                    <p>From chess to modern 4X games, strategy titles teach players to think several moves ahead and anticipate consequences of decisions. This cultivates planning abilities and strategic foresight, helping players develop the habit of considering long-term implications rather than focusing solely on immediate outcomes.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="strategy-benefit-box">
                    <h3>Resource Management</h3>
                    <p>Managing limited resources effectively is a core component of most strategy games. Players learn to prioritize, allocate efficiently, and make trade-offs based on opportunity costs. These skills directly transfer to personal finance, time management, and organizational leadership.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="strategy-benefit-box">
                    <h3>Adaptability</h3>
                    <p>Strategy games present dynamic challenges that require players to adjust their approach as circumstances change. This builds cognitive flexibility and adaptability, essential qualities in today's rapidly changing educational and professional environments where rigid thinking can become a liability.</p>
